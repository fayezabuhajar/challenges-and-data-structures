# Problem: Linked List Rotate by k

This project provides a solution to rotating a singly linked list left by k places. The goal is to move the node at position k to become the new head while keeping the rest of the nodes in order. Negative values of k indicate rotation to the right. Edge cases such as k is negative, k = 0, or k larger than the list length are handled.
