# Problem: Binary Tree

This project implements a binary tree data structure that stores data hierarchically, where each node has up to two children. It supports inserting elements and traversing the tree in pre-order, in-order, and post-order forms. Edge cases such as inserting into an empty tree or handling duplicates are managed safely.


# problem: Binary Serach Tree

This project provides an implementation of a binary search tree (BST) data structure. It supports adding, removing, and searching for values efficiently. Edge cases like duplicates and empty tree are handled.
