# Problem: Binary Tree - Sum of leaf nodes

This project implements a recursive algorithm to calculate the total sum of all leaf nodes in a binary tree.
It uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal to visit every node and identify leaves—nodes with no left or right children.
The algorithm accumulates their values and also records the leaf nodes for reference.
It handles empty trees safely and is written in a clean, modular, and testable structure.
