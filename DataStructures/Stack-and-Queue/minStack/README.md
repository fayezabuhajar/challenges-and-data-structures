# Problem: MinStack

This project provides an implementation of a MinStack data structure.
The goal is to support standard stack operations (push, pop, top, isEmpty) while also allowing retrieval of the minimum element in the stack in constant time.

The MinStack achieves this by maintaining an auxiliary stack to keep track of minimum values as elements are added or removed.
Edge cases such as popping or peeking from an empty stack are handled gracefully.
